This Project is supposed to run the game spades in a GUI. However it enters into an infinite loop, and displays the cards all wrong. It does not work at all. This project needs to undergo a full makeover and change. The goal is to make a full functioning spades game with another option of playing the simple card Game "I Declare war" in a GUI.
